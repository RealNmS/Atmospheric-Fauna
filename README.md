# Atmospheric Fauna

Minecraft mod that adds birds and other fauna making your world feel alive. Hugely inspired by the amazing mod [Cosy Critters & Creepy Crawlies](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosy-critters).

## Description

Atmospheric Fauna is a Fabric mod which I created just to enhance the lonely atmosphere of Minecraft. I decided to add (hugely inpired by [Cosy Critters & Creepy Crawlies](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosy-critters)) particle based birds that can fly around and interact with the world. I'm also using this as a way to learn about modding and coding in Java, because it's something I've wanted to learn for a long time (also I might learn some pixel art as well).

My plan right now is to build a solid foundation for the mod, so I can easily add as many birds and other things I think of during development easily in the future. So far I've used crows as a base bird, but later on I plan on adding a vulture and maybe some smaller birds like sparrows or robins.

For the best experience I recommend using this alongside with [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) to be able to customize the mod to your liking.
